## 💡 Why LUME?


LUME brings **AI-powered control** to your LED strips without sacrificing flexibility. Whether you want to say "make it look like a campfire" or precisely configure sACN universes, LUME handles both.

- **Bring your favorites** — Port effects from WLED, write new ones, or use the built-in collection. You can also add new effects using the pre-written Copilot prompt (see [ADDING_EFFECTS.md](docs/ADDING_EFFECTS.md)).
- **API-first design** — Control via REST, MQTT, sACN, or natural language
- **Hackable** — Clean C++ codebase with effect registration macros and metadata that make each effect's parameters and UI behavior obvious from the code itself

## 🚀 Quick Start

### What You Need

- **ESP32-S3 Board** (tested on LILYGO T-Display S3, should work with most ESP32-S3 boards)
- **WS2812B LED Strip**
- **5V Power Supply** (sized for your LED count: ~60mA per LED at full white)
- **PlatformIO** installed ([get it here](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode))

> 💾 **PSRAM:** Optional. The default 300 LED limit uses only ~6KB of RAM. PSRAM enables future expansion beyond 300 LEDs.

> 🧪 **Hardware Testing Status:** Currently tested on LILYGO T-Display S3. Generic ESP32-S3 configuration compiles successfully and should work on most ESP32-S3 boards. [Report your success!](https://github.com/bring42/LUME/issues)

### Step 1: Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bring42/LUME.git
cd LUME
```

### Step 2: Configure for Your Board

**If you have a generic ESP32-S3 DevKit board:** You're all set! Skip to Step 3.

**If you have a different ESP32-S3 board (LILYGO T-Display S3, etc.):** Edit these files:

#### `platformio.ini` — Set your environment (if needed)

The default is set to `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` which compiles successfully and should work for most generic ESP32-S3 boards.

**For LILYGO T-Display S3** (currently the only tested board), change the default environment:

```ini
[platformio]
default_envs = lilygo-t-display-s3    # ← Change from esp32-s3-devkitc-1
```

**For other boards:** Add a new `[env:yourboard]` section (copy from an existing one), or run `pio boards esp32-s3` to find your board name and create a custom environment.

**Can't find your board?** Check the [PlatformIO board list](https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif32/boards).

**Need more help?** See [HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md#board-configuration) for detailed board configuration guidance, including troubleshooting common issues.

#### [src/constants.h](src/constants.h) — Set your LED pin

```cpp
#define LED_DATA_PIN 21    // ← Change to your wiring (common: 2, 5, 16, 21)
```

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're unsure which pin to use, GPIO 2 or GPIO 16 are safe bets for most ESP32-S3 boards according to claude.

### Step 3: Flash

```bash
pio run -t upload       # Upload firmware
pio run -t uploadfs     # Upload web UI files
```

> ⚠️ **First flash must be via USB.** After that, you can use OTA (see [platformio.ini](platformio.ini) for OTA setup).

### Step 4: First Boot Setup

1. **Power on** your ESP32-S3 board (unplug/replug USB or connect to external 5V power)
2. **Connect** to WiFi network `LUME-Setup` (password: `ledcontrol`)
3. **Open** `lume.local` in your browser
4. **Configure** your home WiFi, LED count, and [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (optional)
5. **Done!** Hit save configuration, reboot the board and connect to your WiFi. Access via `http://lume.local`

> 💾 **Your settings are saved to flash memory** and survive firmware updates. You only need to configure once.

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <b>Troubleshooting Board Issues</b></summary>

**Build fails or upload hangs?** Your board might need different settings:

1. **Check build flags in `platformio.ini`**  
   The `-DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM` flag is optional (only needed for >300 LEDs). Some boards may have issues with `-DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1`. Try removing these flags if you get compile errors.

2. **Upload not working?**  
   - Make sure your USB cable supports data (not just charging)
   - Try holding the BOOT button while uploading
   - Some boards need `upload_speed = 115200` instead of `921600`

3. **LEDs not lighting up?**  
   - Double-check `LED_DATA_PIN` in [constants.h](src/constants.h)
   - Verify your LED strip ground is connected to ESP32 ground
   - Check that your power supply is adequate

4. **Can't find board type?**  
   - Use `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` as a generic fallback
   - Search your board name + "platformio" to find community configs

**Still stuck?** Open an issue with your board model and error message.

<summary>🛠️ <b>Dev Notes</b></summary>

**Skip the setup wizard:** Create `src/secrets.h` from [secrets.h.example](src/secrets.h.example) to auto-configure on boot. Useful when reflashing frequently during development.

```cpp
#define DEV_WIFI_SSID "YourNetwork"
#define DEV_WIFI_PASSWORD "YourPassword"
#define DEV_API_KEY "sk-or-..."
```

**Full erase:** To wipe all saved settings: `pio run -t erase`

What you need to change for different boards:

| Your Board | Files to Edit | What to Change |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1** (untested) | `constants.h` | Set `LED_DATA_PIN` to your wiring |
| **LILYGO T-Display S3** (tested ✅) | `platformio.ini` | Set `default_envs = lilygo-t-display-s3` |
| **Other ESP32-S3** (should work) | `platformio.ini`<br>`constants.h` | Find board with `pio boards esp32-s3`<br>Set `LED_DATA_PIN` to your wiring |
| **Having issues?** | See [HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md#board-configuration) | Detailed troubleshooting & build flags |

## 🎮 Control Methods


### Web UI
Access the responsive web interface from any device on your network.

### AI Prompts
Tell the LEDs what you want:
- *"gentle ocean waves"*
- *"warm fireplace glow"*  
- *"rainbow that slowly shifts colors"*
- *"cozy sunset vibes"*

### API
Full REST API for automation and integration ([see full docs](docs/API_V2.md)):
```bash
# Set all LEDs to red
curl -X POST http://lume.local/api/pixels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fill": [255, 0, 0]}'

# Generate an AI effect
curl -X POST http://lume.local/api/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "northern lights"}'
```

### sACN/E1.31
Connect professional lighting software like QLC+, xLights, or TouchDesigner.

### MQTT (Untested)
Integrate with Home Assistant or Node-RED using MQTT topics. See the [MQTT Guide](docs/MQTT.md) for topic structure and setup notes. This feature is available but not fully tested yet.
