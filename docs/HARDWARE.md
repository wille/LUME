# Hardware Setup Guide

## Board Configuration

LUME is configured for **generic ESP32-S3 DevKit boards** by default (compiles successfully, not yet tested in production). It has been thoroughly tested on the **LILYGO T-Display S3** and should work with any ESP32-S3 board. Here's how to set it up for your specific hardware:

> 💾 **PSRAM is optional.** The default configuration (300 LEDs, 8 segments) uses only ~6KB of the ESP32-S3's 512KB internal SRAM. PSRAM is only needed if you want to significantly increase the LED count beyond 300.

### Step 1: Identify Your Board

**Have a generic ESP32-S3 DevKit?** The default configuration should work. Skip to [Wiring](#wiring-diagram) and test it out!

**Have a LILYGO T-Display S3?** (Currently the only fully tested board) You need to configure these files:

#### 1. Set Board Environment in `platformio.ini`

**For generic ESP32-S3 boards:** Already configured! The default is `esp32-s3-devkitc-1`.

**For LILYGO T-Display S3:** Change the default environment:

```ini
[platformio]
default_envs = lilygo-t-display-s3    ; ← Change from esp32-s3-devkitc-1
```

**For other specific boards:** Find your board identifier:
```bash
pio boards esp32-s3
```

Then either:
- Use an existing environment if available, or
- Create a new `[env:yourboard]` section (copy from `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` and change the `board =` line)

**Common board names:**
- `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` — Generic ESP32-S3 DevKit (most common)
- `esp32s3box` — ESP32-S3-BOX
- `adafruit_feather_esp32s3` — Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3
- `um_tinys3` — Unexpected Maker TinyS3
- `lolin_s3` — WEMOS/Lolin S3

**Can't find your exact board?** Use `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` as a generic fallback — it usually works.

#### 2. Set LED Data Pin in `src/constants.h`

Check your board's pinout diagram and choose a free GPIO pin:
```cpp
#define LED_DATA_PIN 21    // ← Change to your chosen pin
```

**Safe GPIO choices for ESP32-S3:**
- ✅ Good: 2, 5, 12-14, 16-21, 35-37, 47-48
- ⚠️ Avoid: 0 (boot button), 19-20 (USB), 45-46 (strapping pins)

#### 3. Adjust Build Flags (If Needed)

Most boards work with the default settings. If you get compile errors, try removing these flags from `platformio.ini`:

```ini
build_flags = 
    ; -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM         ; ← Optional: Only needed for >300 LEDs
    ; -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1  ; ← Comment out for upload issues
```

### Critical Connections

1. **Data Line (GPIO 21 → DIN):** Keep short, add 330Ω resistor if > 1m
2. **Common Ground:** ESP32 GND must connect to LED strip GND
3. **Power Injection:** For strips > 150 LEDs, inject power at both ends

### Logic Level Shifting

The ESP32-S3 outputs 3.3V logic, while WS2812B LEDs expect 5V signals. In practice, **most WS2812B strips work fine with 3.3V** because they typically recognize anything above ~2.5V as HIGH.

However, if you experience flickering, glitching, or random colors—especially with longer data wires—you may need a level shifter:

- **74AHCT125** (recommended) - Simple, fast, reliable
- **74HCT245** - Bidirectional, overkill for LEDs but common
- **Dedicated level shifter boards** - Many available on Amazon/AliExpress

> **Tip:** Before adding a level shifter, try keeping the data wire short (<30cm) and adding a 330Ω resistor in series. This solves most issues.

## Power Calculation

Each WS2812B LED draws up to **60mA at full white brightness**.

| LED Count | Max Current | Recommended PSU |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 30 | 1.8A | 5V 2A |
| 60 | 3.6A | 5V 5A |
| 100 | 6A | 5V 10A |
| 160 | 9.6A | 5V 10A |
| 300 | 18A | 5V 20A |

**Good news:** The firmware includes automatic power limiting. Configure your PSU capacity in [constants.h](../src/constants.h):

```cpp
constexpr uint8_t LED_VOLTAGE = 5;           // 5V LEDs
constexpr uint16_t LED_MAX_MILLIAMPS = 2000; // Your PSU limit in mA
```

FastLED will automatically dim LEDs to stay within the power budget.

## GPIO Pin Configuration

**Default data pin: GPIO 21**

To use a different GPIO pin:

1. Edit [constants.h](../src/constants.h)
2. Change `LED_DATA_PIN` to your desired GPIO:
   ```cpp
   #define LED_DATA_PIN 16  // Example: use GPIO 16 instead
   ```
3. Rebuild and flash: `pio run -t upload`

> **Note:** The pin is set at compile time (FastLED requirement). Changing it requires reflashing.

### Recommended GPIOs for ESP32-S3

| GPIO | Safe? | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2, 5 | ✅ Good | Commonly available, safe choices |
| 12-14 | ✅ Good | General purpose |
| 16-18 | ✅ Good | General purpose |
| 21 | ✅ Default | Current default pin |
| 35-37 | ✅ Good | General purpose |
| 47-48 | ✅ Good | General purpose, but check your board |
| 0 | ⚠️ Avoid | Boot button |
| 19-20 | ⚠️ Avoid | USB D- and D+ |
| 45-46 | ⚠️ Avoid | Strapping pins, can cause boot issues |

**Check your board's pinout!** Some boards use certain GPIOs for onboard peripherals (display, buttons, SD card, etc.). Consult your board's documentation or schematic.

## LED Strip Types

The firmware is configured for **WS2812B (GRB)** strips. To use other types:

Edit [core/controller.cpp](../src/core/controller.cpp):

```cpp
// WS2812B (most common, GRB order)
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, LED_DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds_, ledCount_);

// WS2811 (12V strips, RGB order)
FastLED.addLeds<WS2811, LED_DATA_PIN, RGB>(leds_, ledCount_);

// SK6812 (RGBW - note: W channel not yet supported)
FastLED.addLeds<SK6812, LED_DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds_, ledCount_);

// APA102/SK9822 (2-wire, needs clock pin)
FastLED.addLeds<APA102, DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, BGR>(leds_, ledCount_);
```

---

## First Power-On

1. **Connect USB-C or Micro-USB** to your ESP32-S3 board (cable must support data, not just charging)
2. **Flash firmware** via PlatformIO:
   ```bash
   pio run -t upload
   ```
3. **Connect to WiFi** `LUME-Setup` (password: `ledcontrol`)
4. **Open** `http://192.168.4.1`
5. **Configure** your home WiFi in Settings
6. **Done!** Access via `http://lume.local`

## Troubleshooting

### LEDs not lighting up

1. ✅ Check 5V power is connected
2. ✅ Verify GND is shared between ESP32 and LED strip
3. ✅ Confirm data wire is on GPIO 21 (or your configured pin)
4. ✅ Try a shorter data wire or add 330Ω resistor
5. ✅ Check serial monitor for errors

### Only first few LEDs light up

- Data signal integrity issue
- Add a 330-470Ω resistor between GPIO and first LED
- Ensure good solder joints
- Try shorter data cable

### Colors are wrong

- Check color order (GRB vs RGB)
- Edit `FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, 21, GRB>` → try `RGB` or `BRG`

### Random flickering

- Add 1000µF capacitor across power lines
- Ensure adequate power supply
- Check for loose connections
- Reduce brightness if PSU is undersized

### Device keeps rebooting

- Power supply can't handle load
- Reduce `LED_MAX_MILLIAMPS` in constants.h
- Check for short circuits

---

## Advanced: Parallel Output

For very long strips (500+ LEDs), you can reduce latency by using multiple GPIO pins in parallel. This requires firmware modifications:

```cpp
// Example: 4 parallel outputs
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, 21>(leds, 0, 125);          // LEDs 0-124
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, 16>(leds, 125, 125);        // LEDs 125-249
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, 17>(leds, 250, 125);        // LEDs 250-374
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, 18>(leds, 375, 125);        // LEDs 375-499
```

This is not enabled by default—modify source if needed.
